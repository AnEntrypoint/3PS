## Collection Schemas

### Team

- **Storage**: `/static/storage/pbc_3824009647/`

### Musicians
- **Fields**: name, genre, bio, site, route
- **Storage**: `/static/storage/5rod2tewrl0ov3d/`

### Artists
- **Fields**: title, desc, bio, site, route
- **Storage**: `/static/storage/3jnleendml5ld46/`

## Technical Details

### File Processing
- Images are automatically resized to max 2000x2000px
- JPEG quality set to 85% for optimal size/quality balance
- Files are named with random suffixes to prevent conflicts
- Thumbnails are not generated (handled by the main site)

### Data Format
- All records include: `id`, `created`, `updated`, `collectionName`
- Image references are stored as JSON arrays in the `pic` field
- Generated IDs are 15-character PocketBase-compatible strings

### Security Notes
- **Local Only**: This editor is designed for local development use
- **No Authentication**: Do not expose this to the public internet
- **File Validation**: Only image files are allowed for upload
- **Size Limits**: 10MB maximum file size per image

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3001 is busy, edit `server.js` and change the PORT variable.

### Permission Errors
Make sure you have write permissions to the project directory.

### File Upload Issues
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Ensure file is a valid image format
- Check available disk space

### Git Integration
Make sure you're in the correct git repository and have push permissions.

## Development Mode

For development with auto-restart on changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This uses Node.js `--watch` flag to automatically restart the server when files change.

## Advanced Usage

### Bulk Operations
For bulk data operations, you can directly edit the JSON files in `/data/` directory, but be careful with the format and IDs.

### Custom Fields
To add new fields to collections, update both `server.js` (COLLECTIONS config) and `app.js` (collectionConfigs).

### Image Optimization
The Sharp library handles image optimization. You can adjust quality and resize settings in the upload handler in `server.js`.
